Hey, this is Tarnadas and I have some interesting news for you today!

I would like to announce that Net64+ will from now on be in a passive maintenance mode, meaning I will no longer develop new features.
This does not mean, that I abandon this project.
Instead, I will keep the server list running, which is like the only infrastructure that needs to be hosted.
The server list is powered by its users.
Everyone can host his own server by following [one](https://net64-mod.github.io/wiki/hosting/public/) of our [documentations](https://net64-mod.github.io/wiki/hosting/docker/).
The [client](https://github.com/Tarnadas/net64plus) and [server](<(https://github.com/Tarnadas/net64plus-server)>) are also Open Source and I will still accept new Pull Requests.

Our team thinks that Net64 has its place as an easy way to play Super Mario 64 with your friends or as a speedrunning game,
but things change and with the rise of the [decompilation project](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64) and its derivates, we have to move on and think about whether the design of Net64 can keep up with these recent changes in the ecosystem.
The answer to this is "no".

The core of Net64 is written in Assembly and only a handful of people are capable to efficiently develop new features or do any kind of significant code changes.
The decompilation of SM64 enables a new group of developers to work on stuff, which would have also been possible via Assembly, but it's just way too complicated and consumes too much time.
