Hey, we have some interesting news for you today!

We would like to announce that Net64+ will from now on be in a passive maintenance mode, meaning Tarnadas will no longer develop new features.
That does not mean the project will be abandoned. The server list will stay online and everyone can host his own server by following [one](https://net64-mod.github.io/wiki/hosting/public/) of our [documentations](https://net64-mod.github.io/wiki/hosting/docker/).
The [client](https://github.com/Tarnadas/net64plus) and [server](<(https://github.com/Tarnadas/net64plus-server)>) are also Open Source and Tarnadas will accept new Pull Requests as always.

We'd also like to announce that development of version 3.0 will be halted. Not only is progress slow because only Henrik is working on it but with the advent of SM64 ports many other projects have emerged implementing multiplayer. These projects ported SM64 to various platforms like Windows or the web and are far easier to set up, easier to develop and therefore far better supported. Even if Net64 3.0 would release today these other projects would be superior in every way. We don't feel like working on something that will be obsolete before it's released. At the end of this post we'll add some links so you can check these projects out.

SM64JS paragraph

Net64 was the first SM64 online mod. It was groundbreaking at the time but nowadays the SM64 decompilation has allowed much more complex mods to be developed by a much wider group of developers. Don't be sad that Net64 has reached its end of life, these projects are the logical and spiritual successors of Net64. Net64 will remain an option for speedrunners and everyone preferring its "native feel" but anyone looking for more characters, maps, gamemodes or better synchonization will appreciate these new projects.

Lastly we want to thank everyone who made Net64 to what it is:
- [MelonSpeedruns](https://twitter.com/MelonSpeedruns), for turning a childhood dream into a real thing.
- [Kaze](https://twitter.com/KazeEmanuar) for developing the assembly and making the mod go viral.
- [Guad](https://github.com/Guad) for developing the first client. 
- [Marshivolt](https://twitter.com/Marshivolt), Cjes and TheAnkleDestroyer for creating the character models.
- Our ex-Discord staff: [Marionova](https://twitter.com/Marionova64) and Jim-panse for building the community from the ground up.
- Our current Discord staff: Bill and [Jman](https://twitter.com/PailBot) for supporting us and keeping the server alive.
- All server hosters for providing the community with servers to play on without portforwarding.

Thanks everyone! Without you.
